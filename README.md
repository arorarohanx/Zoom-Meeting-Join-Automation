Make sure you have Zoom installed on your Pc/Laptop and sign in the zoom else it won't work

You can easily play this just follow few steps : -

1.Open any good IDE (vscode,pycharm or any good one..)

2.Install PyAutoGui in the terminal by just pasting this command "pip install PyAutoGUI" ,intall "pip install python-time" and also install "pip install pyttsx3" if you guys don't know how to put command in terminal refer this "https://youtu.be/9Q-4sZF0_CE"

3.After Installation just simply put the code and enter the code, name, and password of zoom meeting in the input ( when you will run the program it will take a input basically in the output screen )

4.Then Enjoy your meeting :)
